In science the filesystem often serves as a de-facto database, with directory
trees the zeroth-order data structure for scientific data. But it can be
tedious and error prone to work with directory trees to retrieve and store
datasets. **datreant** makes working with directory structures and files
Pythonic with **Treants**: specially marked directories with distinguishing
characteristics that can be discovered, queried, and filtered. Treants make it
easy to quickly gather results from many studies scattered throughout a
filesystem, operate on their stored data based on their metadata, and store
results again as necessary within their directory trees. **datreant** also
allows granular manipulation of individual directories and files and makes
working with aggregations of many Treants, directories, and files just as
straightforward.

In many fields of science, especially those analyzing experimental or
simulation data, there is an existing ecosystem of specialized tools and file
formats which new tools must work around. Often this makes the filesystem serve
as a de-facto database, with directory trees the zeroth-order data structure
for scientific data. But it can be tedious and error prone to work with these
directory trees to retrieve and store datasets.

To address this problem, we present [**datreant**](http://datreant.org/).
At the core of datreant are **Treants**: specially marked directories with
distinguishing characteristics that can be discovered, queried, and filtered.
Treants give a Pythonic approach to managing heterogeneous data stored in the
filesystem and therefore help to enhance productivity and scientific
reproducibility.

Treants make it easy to quickly gather results from many studies scattered
throughout a filesystem, operate on their stored data based on their metadata,
and store results again as necessary within their directory trees.
**datreant** also provides Tree and Leaf classes for granular manipulation of
individual directories and files, respectively, as well as Bundles and Views
for working with aggregations of many Treants, Trees, and Leaves.

[**datreant**](http://datreant.org) is a namespace package, with the core
components available in the dependency-light
[datreant.core](https://github.com/datreant/datreant.core) module. All core
datreant objects are extendable; an example of this is
[datreant.data](https://github.com/datreant/datreant.data), which provides a
convenience interface for storing and retrieving `numpy` and `pandas` data
structures in HDF5 using h5py and PyTables internally.

**datreant** is also designed with specialized applications for data management
in mind. For working with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data,
[**MDSynthesis**](https://github.com/datreant/MDSynthesis)—built on top of
datreant—streamlines workflow through **Sim** objects. **Sims** are special
**Treants** that use [MDAnalysis](http://www.mdanalysis.org/) to dissect MD
trajectories, providing mechanisms for storing system definitions and custom atom
selections. This makes it possible to write maintainable analysis code that
works across many simulation variants.

All current datreant subpackages are openly developed and freely available
under a BSD 3-clause license. More information on how to use the software,
and how to get involved, can be found on the [datreant
website](http://datreant.org/).
